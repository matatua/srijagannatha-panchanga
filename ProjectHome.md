### Testing and Validation ###

  * The Sri Jagannatha panchanga executed successfully on Windows Mobile device (HP Voice Messenger, iPAQ). The files were copied to the SD card and the .html files were opened in the internet explorer.

  * Sri Jagannatha Panchanga Lite (SJPL.html) version was successfully executed on Android 2.0 device with Sky-fire browser (Samsung Galaxy I551). Please note that the default Android browser was not able to run the JavaScript files So, as alternative Sky-fire browser was used. Save the files in a SD card folder and open the file in Sky-fire using files command like [file:///mnt/sdcard/panchanga/SJPL.html](file:///mnt/sdcard/panchanga/SJPL.html) , After it opens successfully mark the page as bookmark/favorites.
